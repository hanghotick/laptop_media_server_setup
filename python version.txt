"""
Imagine a Python script designed for setting up the ultimate media server on a
headless Ubuntu/Debian laptop. This script aims for efficiency and headless
operation.

The script should perform the following actions:

Core Media Server Installation:

1. Install CasaOS:
   - Implement logic to download and install the latest stable version of CasaOS
     following the official installation instructions.
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies (including Docker) are installed correctly.
   - Set up CasaOS User: Create a dedicated user named 'peter' specifically
     for CasaOS access. This might involve interacting with CasaOS's internal
     user management or a command-line interface if provided.
   - Set up CasaOS Password: Set the password for the 'peter' user within
     CasaOS to '121215'.

2. Install TLP (if not already present):
   - Implement logic to check if TLP is installed and install it if not.

Headless Server Configuration:

3. Configure Lid Close Behavior (Power Management):
   - Implement logic to configure the system (likely through systemd-logind
     configuration files) so that closing the laptop lid immediately turns off
     the screen.
   - Implement logic to configure the system (again, likely through
     systemd-logind configuration files) to explicitly prevent the laptop
     from entering sleep, suspend, or hibernate modes when the lid is closed.
     The server should continue running uninterrupted.

Performance and Efficiency:

4. Automatic CPU Management:
   - Implement logic to check if 'cpufrequtils' is installed and install it if not.
   - Implement logic to set the CPU governor to 'ondemand'. This governor
     dynamically adjusts CPU frequency based on the current system load.

Enhancements and Considerations (Implement these as part of the script):

5. Network Configuration:
   - Set Static IP Address: Implement logic to configure the primary network
     interface to use the static IP address '192.168.1.160'. This will involve
     modifying the appropriate network configuration files based on the
     Ubuntu/Debian version (e.g., /etc/netplan/*.yaml or /etc/network/interfaces).
     The script should identify the primary network interface and modify its
     configuration accordingly.
   - Firewall Configuration (UFW):
     - Implement logic to install UFW if not present.
     - Implement logic to enable UFW.
     - Implement logic to allow necessary ports: SSH (port 22), CasaOS (check
       CasaOS documentation for default port, e.g., port 80), and any other
       services you plan to run.

6. User and Security Setup:
   - Create Administrative User: Implement logic to create a new user named
     'peter' with 'sudo' privileges for system administration.
   - Set SSH Password: Implement logic to set the password for the newly
     created 'peter' user for SSH access to 'merigold'.
     Security Recommendation: Include a note within the script strongly
     recommending the use of SSH keys instead of password-based authentication
     for production environments and potentially offer an option to configure
     SSH keys.

7. Storage Management:
   - Mounting External Drives (Optional): Include commented-out examples or
     logic to identify and persistently mount external drives using 'fstab'.
     Emphasize the importance of using UUIDs for reliable mounting.
   - Disk Health Monitoring (Optional): Include logic to install 'smartmontools'
     and a suggestion to configure automatic SMART tests.

8. System Maintenance:
   - Enable Automatic Updates (Optional but Recommended): Include commented-out
     logic or instructions to configure automatic security updates using
     'unattended-upgrades'.
   - Regular Updates Reminder: Include a function or message within the script
     to remind the user to regularly update the system using 'apt update' and
     'apt upgrade'.

9. Logging and Monitoring (Optional):
   - Suggest installing 'htop' and 'vnstat' with instructions on how to do so.

10. User Experience:
    - Clear Output: Use Python's 'print()' function to provide informative output
      to the terminal at each stage of the installation.
    - Comments: Thoroughly comment the script to explain each function and
      section.
    - Error Handling (Basic): Implement basic 'try-except' blocks to catch
      potential issues during command execution and provide informative error
      messages.

Desired Outcome:

Executing this Python script should result in:

- CasaOS installed and accessible through a web browser on '192.168.1.160'
  (assuming default HTTP port 80).
- TLP installed and managing power.
- The laptop screen turning off when the lid is closed, without the system
  going to sleep/suspend.
- CPU frequency scaling managed automatically by the 'ondemand' governor.
- A static IP address configured.
- UFW firewall enabled with necessary ports open.
- A new user 'peter' with 'sudo' privileges and an SSH password of 'merigold'.
- Optional suggestions and commented-out code for storage management and
  monitoring.

The script should be designed to be executed with 'sudo python <script_name>.py'
due to the system-level changes it will perform.
